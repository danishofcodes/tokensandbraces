                <p><b style={{ fontSize: "20px" }}>A dusty Pentium 3 in 2008</b> became my gateway to a digital wonderland. Sketching in MSPaint with colorful lines which were nothing but pixels in reality, and that facinated me, and of course pc games. Soon, I was tinkering on that clunky machine, sparking a lifelong fascination with the world of computers. 

In school, I practically lived in the computer lab, often extending my stays by convincing teachers I was absorbed in learning â€” when really, I was immersed in building cool mini projects in Java with my teacher.

Fast forward 6 years, and I'm a frontend developer, crafting user interfaces that are as sleek as they are functional. But my passion lies at the crossroads of design and engineering: building software that's beautiful on the outside and rock-solid within. 

Currently, I'm delving deeper into the backend, creating utility and productivity web apps. 

My ultimate goal? To become a full-stack developer, someone who can build beautiful frontend and and reliably-solid back-end, optimised for every kind of users. 

But my life isn't all ones and zeros. When I'm not coding, I'm lost in a good book, catching up on the latest superhero sagas (MCU or DC, no bias here!), or indulging in the holy trinity of comfort food: pizza, burgers, and biryani. </p>
